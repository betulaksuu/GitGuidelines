#  Git Branch For Small Project



### Separate your branches into two main branch: 

### Master branch
Master is  production. Master branch stores the official release history. It contains an abridged version of your project. It is the core of the branching model with an infinite lifetime. 
 
### Develop branch

Develop  is not production. Develop branch  is an integration branch for features. It contains the complete history of your project. It also has an infinite lifetime. When the code in this branch is stable and ready for a release, the changes are merged to the master branch and tagged with a release number.
